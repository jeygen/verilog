/*
    Assume that you have a binary file that represents a block of memory from an embedded system. Write a function in Verilog to read this file and search for a specific sequence of bytes.

    In firmware development, reading and writing to hardware registers is a common task. Write a function in Verilog to read and write to a memory-mapped I/O device.

    Implement a simple power management unit in Verilog that can turn on and off components based on some criteria.

    How would you write a testbench in Verilog for validating a new System-on-Chip (SoC) design?

    Design a simple machine learning accelerator in Verilog. How would you handle communication with the host system and data transfer?
